    <h1>THE DARK NIGHT RISES</h1>
    <p>The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Featuring the DC
      Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a sequel to 2005's Batman
      Begins, starring an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart,
      Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman. In the film, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Bale), James Gordon (Oldman) and Harvey Dent

  <section class=" container plot-section" id="plot">
    <h1>Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman:</h1>
    <p>A billionaire socialite who dedicates himself to protecting Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked
      vigilante hailed as its "Dark Knight" at night. Bale said he was confident in his choice to return in the role because
      of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and
      performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle as in the previous film because the new Batsuit allowed
      him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether "[his crusade is] something that has an
      end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion
      and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have
      to exorcise your demons."He added, "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer,
      you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference
      between attaining that power and holding on to it."Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in
      the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: "I have no problem
      with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie."</p>
    <h1>Heath Ledger as The Joker:</h1>
    <p>A mighty murderous and psychopathic criminal mastermind who is portraying himself as an "agent of chaos", who rises to
      dominant power by terrorizing Gotham and plunging it into anarchy. Before Ledger was confirmed for the role in July
      2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme,Adrien Brody,Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However,
      Nolan had wanted to work with Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger
      for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character.[23]
      When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's
      tone: he described his Joker as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." In the film,
      the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of
      chemical bleaching, as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire
      to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role,
      Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept
      a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings.While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually
      generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given Batman: The
      Killing Joke and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, which he "really tried to read and put it down."
      Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as "a very early starting point for Christian [Bale] and I. But
      we kind of flew far away from that pretty quickly and into another world altogether." "There's a bit of everything
      in him. There's nothing that consistent," Ledger said, and added, "There are a few more surprises to him."Ledger was
      allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different
      from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot
      the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall). On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The
      Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial
      tributes. "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day [during
      editing]," Nolan recalled. "But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance
      that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed
      them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no "digital effects" to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously.[30]
      Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory.</p>

        <h1>Christopher Nolan</h1>
        <h4>Having made his directorial debut with Following (1998), Nolan gained considerable attention for his second feature, Memento (2000), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The acclaim garnered by his independent films gave Nolan the opportunity to make the big-budget thriller Insomnia (2002) and the mystery drama The Prestige (2006). He found further popular and critical success with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012); Inception (2010), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a second Original Screenplay nomination; Interstellar (2014) and Dunkirk (2017). His nine films have grossed over US$4.3 billion worldwide and garnered a total of 26 Oscar nominations and seven wins. Nolan has co-written several of his films with his younger brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.</h4>
